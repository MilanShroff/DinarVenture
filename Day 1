1. Difference between AI, ML, and DL  
What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence is a broad branch of computer science that aims to create systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. This includes things like:
Understanding language: chatbots, voice assistants.
Visual perception: facial recognition in smartphones.
Decision making: automated trading in stock markets.
Problem-solving: robots planning the best way to complete tasks.
So, AI is an umbrella term — it includes everything that makes a machine appear smart.
What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI. Instead of programming every single rule, we teach the machine to learn from data. This makes the system adaptable, so it can improve its performance over time.
How it works:
We feed the computer a lot of historical data.
The system finds patterns in that data.
It uses these patterns to predict or decide things in new situations.
Example:
If you upload lots of cat and dog photos, a machine learning model learns how to tell them apart. Over time, it gets better as it sees more images.
Types of Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning: The data is labeled (e.g., “This is a cat”, “This is a dog”).
Unsupervised Learning: The data isn’t labeled — the system finds hidden groups or patterns by itself (like customer segmentation).
Reinforcement Learning: The system learns by trial and error, getting rewards for doing tasks correctly (like training a robot to walk).
What is Deep Learning (DL)?
Deep Learning is a specialized subfield of ML. It uses artificial neural networks — models inspired by the way the human brain works.
Key feature:
These networks have many layers (that’s why it’s called “deep”). Each layer processes data and passes it to the next, helping the system learn complex patterns.
Where it’s used:
Image recognition (unlocking your phone with your face).
Speech recognition (Siri, Google Assistant).
Self-driving cars (understanding surroundings in real time).
Medical diagnostics (detecting tumors in scans).

In Otherwods:
AI: The big goal — machines that act smart.
ML: One method to achieve AI — teach machines to learn from data.
DL: An advanced way to do ML — using deep neural networks for really complex tasks.
2. Real life applications of AI

1️⃣ Healthcare:
Detecting diseases in medical images (like X-rays or MRIs).
Virtual health assistants that remind patients to take medicine.
Predicting disease outbreaks using data trends.
2️⃣ Transport:
Self-driving cars (Tesla, Waymo).
AI in traffic control systems to reduce congestion.
Ride-sharing apps (Uber, Ola) that match drivers with passengers using AI.
3️⃣ Finance:
Detecting unusual spending patterns to catch fraud.
Robo-advisors for investment suggestions.
Credit scoring and loan approvals.
4️⃣ Social Media:
Facebook and Instagram use AI to recommend posts and filter content.
Face tagging in photos.
Detecting harmful content or spam.
5️⃣ Entertainment:
Netflix or YouTube recommending what to watch next.
Video game characters that adapt to how you play.
6️⃣ Smart Homes:
Smart assistants (Alexa, Google Home) controlling lights, music, and appliances.
Smart thermostats that learn your temperature preferences.
